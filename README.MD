Etch A Sketch - Grid Painter

This project is a modern, web-based take on the classic Etch A Sketch toy. It allows users to draw on a dynamic grid, change the grid size, select colors, and use an eraser, offering an interactive way to apply JavaScript skills in DOM manipulation.

Features
1. Customizable Grid: Users can adjust the grid size using a simple input field, ranging from 1x1 to 100x100 squares.
2. Color Selection: A color picker is available for users to choose the color they want to paint with.
3. Eraser Mode: Users can activate the eraser by pressing the "CTRL" key, allowing them to erase previously painted squares.
4. Real-Time Drawing: As the mouse hovers over the grid, the selected color is applied, giving an intuitive drawing experience.
